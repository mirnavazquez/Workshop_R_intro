# Workshop introduction to R

Hello, this is our first try to make an R introduction workshop. I will try to give you an idea of all the things that can be done in R and how it can be fun! :p

To download the material, click on **Code** and select **Download zip**, or clone the repo using **git clone on your terminal**.

# Software
